# 📚 Notes – Simplifying Exam Prep for Students

**Notes** is a side project I built to help students of my college easily access study notes for their exams. The application features a simple user interface where students can find subject-wise links that direct them to Google Drive folders containing all the relevant notes.

- No login or extra navigation is required—just one click to start preparing.
